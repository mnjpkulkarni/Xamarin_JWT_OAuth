This Xamarin Forms Mobile App acts as a client for JWT Authentication and Authorization. Please refer to the JWT Server implementation in one of my repositories.

2. Login first using 
            username: "manoj"
            password: "password"
 3. You will see the token on the screen.
 4. Then hit the "Get Cricketers" to see the secured data.
